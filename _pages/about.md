### Career
I am a Python developer who is comfortable working with Pandas, Numpy, Scipy, Scikit-learn, Keras, Matplotlib, Flask and other libraries. In the last couple of years, I have become fascinated by how large, noisy and messy datasets can tell compelling stories when carefully manipulated and used to train complex machine learning models. I recently did a data science bootcamp to invest time and energy into getting my head around cutting-edge tools and processes. This is an exciting and challenging journey, and I am always looking for opportunities to learn, grow and contribute.

At the moment, I am learning as much as I can about blockchain technology, how it currently intersects with AI technology and potential future applications in the space. One of the strongest merits of a decentralised distributed ledger is that it lessens the trust required by participating individuals and parties, without the involvement of third parties. If setup in a robust manner, I believe that blockchain technology together with AI technology can play an important role in mitigating risks, such as: fraud, embezzlement and false insurance claims; much to benefit of financial stakeholders and society as a whole. This is an area that I would like to continuing focusing on.

I am currently drafting up a project in my free time in which a variety of widely available data online would be used to predict otherwise unforeseen environmental risks to assets, such as market volatility, political instability, rising commodity prices, sudden exchange rate fluctuations or diplomatic crises. The scope for this project is very wide and it could apply to a range of domains, including aerospace, medicine and infrastructure, which are very capital intensive and involve a wide range of complexities.

### Personal life
I was born in New Zealand, however I grew up and spent most of my life in Melbourne, Australia. When I was fifteen years old, I took my first flying lessons, which soon turned into an exciting hobby. After school, I transitioned into commercial flight training and learned a lot about my strengths and weaknesses. I learned to fly an aeroplane before I could drive a car, and I'll never forget the feeling of taxiing onto the runway for the first time with an empty seat next to me. Taking control of an airplane changed my outlook on life and I hope to return to this exciting hobby in the future.

I decided to study aerospace engineering at university, as I enjoy making things and clearly I am interested in aviation. I was fortunate to have the chance to study in China and The Netherlands, and do an internship in Austria during my years as a student. The time that I spent overseas gave me a strong desire to return to Asia, experience working in a completely different environment and try to pick up a second language.

After graduation, I took an opportunity to live in Japan and teach English for a while. This lead to an opportunity to work in international marketing at a Japanese manufacturing company, alongside engineers. I would have to say it was one of the most challenging periods of my life because it was necessary to adapt to a Japanese working culture and speak Japanese in the workplace, as well learn a lot about battery technology and the business landscape. As with flying, I hope to return to Japan one day.

These days I spend a lot time investigating what makes a person a great entrepreneur. I think that in order for someone to change the world, they need to have a strong vision and the ability to meet people who are willing to get behind that vision. Entrepreneurship seems to be evolving into a form that is more accessible to more people, and it is exciting to see how small teams of people are having such a big impact on the global community at large.

When I have time, I enjoy travelling to new destinations, DJing, hiking, skiing and writing.
