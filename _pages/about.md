# Professional trajectory
I am a Python developer who can comfortably work with data using the Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, Keras, Scipy, Matplotlib and Flask libraries, as well as other libraries. I have become passionate about data and stories that can be revealed from it when it is treated with care and put through smart algorithms. I recently did a data science bootcamp to invest time and energy into getting my head around cutting edge tools and processes. This is an exciting and fulfilling path to be on and I am always looking for new opportunities to learn, grow and contribute.

At the moment, I am working on a project that involves scraping data from the web and using machine learning tools to predict market risks, especially in relation to cryptocurrencies. I think that blockchain has an important role to play across all industries and it's necessary for people to be educated on what how the technology actually works, the broader range of benefits it can offer, what are its risks, and most interestingly to me, how can those risks be mitigated. In addition, I am exploring unique approaches for training a time-series forecasting model that can accurately predict using unseen data, without needing to be retrained. In particular, I am interested in combining the strengths of machine learning and blockchain technology to predict future risks.

#Who I am
I was born in New Zealand, however I grew up and spent most of my life in Melbourne, Australia. When I was fifteen years old, I took my first flying lessons. This was a great chapter in my life, because I experienced exhilaration and freedom through the flying pursuit.

At university I decided to study aerospace engineering, as I enjoy making things and obviously I am interested in aviation. I was fortunate to have the chance to study in China and The Netherlands and do an internship in Austria during my years as a student. That period has really shaped who I am today.

After graduating from university, I decided to take a break and go to live in Japan and teach English for a while. This lead to an opportunity to work in international marketing at a Japanese manufacturing company, alongside engineers. I would have to say it was one of the most challenging periods of my life because I needed to adapt to Japanese working culture and speak Japanese in the workplace, as well learn a lot about battery technology and the business landscape.

I am very interested in entrepreneurship and disruptive technology - as far as changing the world for the better is concerned - and my hobbies include travelling, DJing, hiking, skiing and writing.
