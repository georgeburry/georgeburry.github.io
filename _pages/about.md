I am a Python developer who can comfortably work with data using the Numpy, Pandas, Sci-kit Learn and Keras libraries. At the moment, I am exploring unique approaches for training a time-series forecasting model that can accurately predict using unseen data, without needing to be retrained. In particular, I am interested in combining the strengths of machine learning and blockchain technology to predict fraud and guard against it.
