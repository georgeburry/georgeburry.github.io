## Career
I am a Python developer who is comfortable working with Pandas, Numpy, Scipy, Scikit-learn, Keras, Matplotlib, Flask and other libraries. In the last couple of years, I have become fascinated by how large, noisy and messy datasets can tell compelling stories when carefully manipulated and combined with the use of clever machine learning algorithms. I recently did a data science bootcamp to invest time and energy into getting my head around cutting-edge tools and processes. This is an exciting and challenging path to be on, and I am always looking for opportunities to learn, grow and contribute.

At the moment, I am using all of the free time that I have to build upon existing competencies and to branch out in new programming languages, technologies and tools. I am particularly interested in how data science and blockchain technologies could be used to mitigate risk in the aerospace, finance and health sectors.

## Personal life
I was born in New Zealand, however I grew up and spent most of my life in Melbourne, Australia. When I was fifteen years old, I took my first flying lessons, which soon turned into an exciting hobby. After school, I transitioned into commercial flight training and learned a lot about my strengths and weaknesses. I learned to fly an aeroplane before I could drive a car, and I'll never forget the feeling of taxiing onto the runway for the first time with an empty seat next to me. Taking control of an airplane changed my outlook on life and I hope to return to this exciting hobby in the future.

I decided to study aerospace engineering at university, as I enjoy making things and clearly I am interested in aviation. I was fortunate to have the chance to study in China and The Netherlands, and do an internship in Austria during my years as a student. The time that I spent overseas gave me a strong desire to return to Asia, experience working in a completely different environment and try to pick up a second language.

After graduation, I took an opportunity to live in Japan and teach English for a while. This lead to an opportunity to work in international marketing at a Japanese manufacturing company, alongside engineers. I would have to say it was one of the most challenging periods of my life because it was necessary to adapt to a Japanese working culture and speak Japanese in the workplace, as well learn a lot about battery technology and the business landscape.

These days I spend a lot time reading and thinking about entrepreneurship. It is exciting to see how small teams of people are having a big impact on the global community at large, across every sector.

When I have time, I enjoy travelling to new destinations, DJing, hiking, skiing and writing.
