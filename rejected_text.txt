I am currently working on a project in my free time in which a variety of widely available data online would be used to predict otherwise unforeseen environmental risks to assets, such as market volatility, political instability, rising commodity prices, sudden exchange rate fluctuations or diplomatic crises. The scope for this project is very wide and it could apply to a range of domains, including aerospace, medicine and infrastructure, which are very capital intensive and require extensive risk management.
